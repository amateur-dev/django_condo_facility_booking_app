# Objective: The residents of the condo should be able to log-in and view/book/cancel the tennis court and barbeque services.

### Key Considerations:

1. There must be a superuser to the entire application that will govern who are the residents and not.  The superuser must be able to remove any user.
2. On sign-up, the superuser must have to “accept”/”reject” the user as a resident.
3. No resident must be able to make more than 3 bookings for each of the service [at any given point of time]
4. No resident must be able to make any booking more than 2 weeks in advance
5. All resident / user will be tied to a unit
6. All units must have a maximum of 2 users registered under their number

_Additional Bonus points:_

Residents should be able to invite other residents for the services that they have booked.
The residents should also be able to propose small gathering amongst residents.
